   <h4><b>Print all the subsequences of the given string</b></h4>
   <h5>Problem Description:-write a program to print all the subsequences of the given string, a subsequence is generated by removing some characters of the string and not changing the order of the string.</h5> 
    <h5>Example:-</h5>
    <h5>INPUT: str = "abc"</h5>
    <h5>OUTPUT: "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"  </h5>
    <h4>Solution:-we will either pick the current character and add it to the (to be printed string) or we not pick the currenct character and directly move to the net character</h4>
   <h5>Time Complexity:- O(2^n) because we have two choices for every character either we pick it or not so there will be total of 2^n subsequences.</h5> 
   <h4>code:-</h4>
